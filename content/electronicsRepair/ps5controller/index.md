A basic fix of a malfuntioning PS5 Controller Joystick

## The Issue

A friend of mine had been complaining that his PS5 controller drifts now and again when held in a specific spot. So, I offered to take a look at it.

## Opening the Controller

I found a video on YouTube of someone opening one of these controllers. He made it look a lot easier than it was for me! After quite some time of 'gentle' prying at the plastic tabs, I managed to open it up. Here's a picture of the controller's insides.

Now, onto the joystick.

## Joystick Troubles

I didn’t have a spare joystick in storage, so I figured I’d try cleaning it. At first, I tried canned air and some isopropyl alcohol on the surface and whatever I could reach, but to no avail.  
I then figured I’d have to disassemble the joystick to get to the contacts themselves. Using a prying tool, I managed to pry the side of the joystick open.

As you can see, we're talking about pretty small components.  
Here are the contacts compared to a SIM-card opener tip and my finger:

I held it open and used a q-tip to clean the metal contacts inside. After that, I put the joystick back together and tested it.  
And voilà! It’s fixed! Honestly, I have no idea what sort of dirt could have gotten inside the joystick like that.  
I read on some forums that it might be leftover carbon from the contacts rubbing on the tracers from frequent joystick use.  
Sounds like bad design to me. Well, at least I got a fun afternoon project out of it!
